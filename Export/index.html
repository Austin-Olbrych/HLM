            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p><br>Back in high school, he and his brother would joke about being the Huffman Landscape Management company when they did odd jobs for the elderly, widows and others in need. Fast-forward 30 years and the name now is applied to his new venture
                — though HLM Property Management provides much more than landscaping — and the acronym signifies something deeper than what they do. He is quick to tell you that it also stands for “He leads me.” “I have felt for a long time that God had
                a far greater plan for me,” he says. “Using the passion to serve and help others was a calling. That is why I followed His plan and started my own business.”<br><br></p>

        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>Rick Huffman, President and founder,&nbsp;was only 16 years old when the concept for HLM was born. With the help of his older brother, the two young kids started out helping local families with any landscape or home improvement projects. As the
            years passed, Rick felt drawn to helping&nbsp;people manage all facets of the care of their homes. With&nbsp;over thirty&nbsp;years of past experience, Rick has the intentions of creating not&nbsp;just a personal property management company,
            but a brand. This brand is&nbsp;to serve wholeheartedly with nothing but compassion. As a&nbsp;Christian company we&nbsp;align ourselves with these core&nbsp;values; to have a high&nbsp;moral character, to be&nbsp;servant oriented, to&nbsp;be
            charitable, humble and most importantly&nbsp;to be&nbsp;real.&nbsp;Our company mission is to make sure that we are not just helping but impacting the lives of those we touch.<br></p>
